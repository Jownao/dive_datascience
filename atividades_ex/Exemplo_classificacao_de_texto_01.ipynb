Em cada um destes modelos vamos alterar alguns atributos com o intuito de ajustar o melhor modelo. \n","\n","### KNN\n","\n","Vamos usar a implementação [`sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html) do KNN no Scikit-Learn. Neste caso, vamos modificar o parâmetro K (número de vizinhos), representado pelo atributo `n_neighbors`. A escolha do melhor valor de K depende dos dados que serão treinados. De forma geral, um valor alto de K reduz os efeitos de ruídos. No entanto, eles tornam os limites de classificação menos distintos, o que pode implicar em erros do modelo. \n","\n","### Árvore de Decisão \n","\n","Vamos usar a implementação [`sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html) da árvore de Decisão do Scikit-Learn. Neste exemplo, vamos trabalhar com dois parâmetros que nos ajudam a controlar o tamanho da árvore de decisão gerada. Lembre que em alguns casos, o tamanho da árvore pode ser um problema. Podar essa árvore pode evitar problemas de consumo de memória e, em alguns casos, evitar uma árvore superajustada que cause o que chamamos de `overfitting`. O tamanho da árvore vai ser controlado pelo parâmetro `max_depth` (A profundidade máxima da árvore. Se `None` (valor padrão), os nós são expandidos até todos os nós serem puros ou até todas as folhas conterem pelo menos `min_samples_split` exemplos). \n","\n","[Ver esse link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46480457/difference-between-min-samples-split-and-min-samples-leaf-in-sklearn-decisiontre) para entender um pouco melhor a diferença de `min_samples_split` e `min_samples_leaf`. \n","\n","### SVM \n","\n","Vamos usar a implementação [`sklearn.svm.SVC`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html) do SVM do Scikit-Learn. Vamos modificar três parâmetros: \n","\n","* `kernel`: Especifica o tipo de kernel que queremos usar no algoritmo. O `rbf` é o padrão e pode assumir os valores `linear`, `poly`, `rbf`, `sigmoid`, `precomputed`. Vamos utilizar o `linear`, `poly` e o `rbf` nos nossos exemplos. \n","* `C`: O `C` é um parâmetro de regularização que controla \"o quanto o modelo erra\". Valores altos implica que o modelo vai errar mais e valores baixos implica em menos erros. Não existe uma regra de que o menor erro implica em um modelo melhor. O parâmetro deve ser modificado e testado para a base de dados. \n","* `gamma`: O `gamma` é um parâmetro utilizado quando trabalhamos com o kernel `rbf` que ajuda a controlar o quanto de curvatura vamos querer no modelo. Maior valor implica em maior curvaturas e menor, menos curvaturas. Isso ajuda a controlar o quão complexo é o modelo que está sendo gerado. \n","\n","[Veja esse link](https://medium.com/@myselfaman12345/c-and-gamma-in-svm-e6cee48626be) para entender um pouco mais destes parâmetros.\n","\n","\n","Vamos treinar nosso modelos :) \n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CPuAWLBdhPLV"},"source":["## Usando Validação Cruzada\n","\n","Vamos utilizar a validação cruzada para executar os testes dos modelos escolhidos.
